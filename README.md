## Introduction

Hello there! I'm excited to share my latest project, Etch-A-Sketch, with you. It's a fun, interactive tool that I built to really push my DOM manipulation skills. This project is a blend of a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch, designed entirely for the web browser. I faced quite a few challenges while building it, and I learned a ton about JavaScript, CSS, and HTML along the way.

## What I Built

- **A Dynamic Grid**: I created a 16x16 grid of square divs using JavaScript, which was a great exercise in manipulating the DOM.
- **Flexbox for Layout**: I used flexbox to arrange the divs into a grid. This helped me get more practice with flexbox, as I avoided using CSS Grid on purpose.
- **Interactive Drawing Experience**: I implemented a hover effect so that the grid divs change color when the mouse passes over them, mimicking the action of a pen on paper.
- **Customizable Grid Size**: I added a feature where you can enter a new grid size, and the program adjusts accordingly. It was a neat challenge to get this to work smoothly.
- **Performance Optimization**: I set a limit on the grid size to prevent the program from becoming too resource-intensive.

## Skills I Enhanced

- **JavaScript Proficiency**: I improved my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic HTML generation.
- **CSS Mastery**: I deepened my knowledge of flexbox, hover effects, and responsive design.
- **HTML Structuring**: I learned more about structuring web pages effectively and integrating them with JavaScript and CSS.
- **Problem-Solving and Research**: I frequently researched new methods to overcome challenges, which was a huge part of this project.
- **Git and Version Control**: I made sure to commit early and often, which helped me track my progress and manage the project more effectively.

## Challenges and Learning Moments

- **Debugging Skills**: I got better at using browser developer tools to debug JavaScript and CSS layout issues.
- **Interactive Features**: I explored and implemented various methods for user interaction, like hover effects and prompts.
- **Performance Insights**: I learned the importance of balancing functionality and performance, especially in interactive web applications.

## Going the Extra Mile

- **Color Fun**: I added a feature where the squares change to random colors on each interaction.
- **Progressive Darkening**: I also implemented a progressive darkening effect, where each square interaction adds a bit more darkness, up to ten interactions.

## Conclusion

Working on Etch-A-Sketch has been an incredible journey. It pushed my limits, expanded my knowledge, and confirmed my passion for web development. I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed building it!
